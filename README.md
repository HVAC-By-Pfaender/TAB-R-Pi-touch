# TAB-R-Pi-touch
This is the repository for the TAB-R-Pi-touch device from HVAC by PfÃ¤nder. All scripts used are located in this repository.

**The Repository is still in working process.**

## Description
The TAB-R-Pi-touch is based on a Raspberry Pi and the image is available as an open system, which means, it is shipped with recommendation settings from us, but it can be modified from you at any time. 

The shipped image provides a ready-to-use touchpanel system, optimised for the CODESYS web visualization, with many features.

## Features

- A simple graphical user interface for configuration.

  --> Configuration mode is split into two access roles: "Service technician mode" and "Administrator mode".
- Read-only-mode to protect the image file system, especially on power failures.
- Hardware button to get access to the configuration interface or to restart the system. 
- Auto-on mode in case of power failure.
- Integrated VNC server
- Kiosk-mode for CODESYS web visualization with optimised parameters.
- Auto-reconnect in case of a failed connection.
- Emergency touch soft-button to get redirected to the configured start page, in case of a side loading failure.
